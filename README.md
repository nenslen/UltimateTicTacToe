# Ultimate Tic Tac Toe
A large tic tac toe game is formed by a 3x3 grid of regular tic tac toe games. When a small game is complete (X wins, O wins, or tie), the corresponding square in the large game becomes either X, O, or invalid for ties. To win, a player needs to win 3 small games to form a row or column on the large board.

## Implementation
There are currently 3 games modes (human vs human, human vs AI, and AI vs AI). The AI has 2 difficulties (easy and medium), but a harder difficulty is planned for the future (using minimax with alpha-beta).
